# Flex Objects Plugin

## About

The **Flex Objects** Plugin is for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav).  Flex objects allows you to create collections of objects, which can modified by CRUD operations via the admin plugin to easily manage large sets of data that don't fit as simple YAML configuration files, or Grav pages. These objects are defined by blueprint written in YAML and they are rendered by a set of twig files. Additionally both objects and collections can be customized by PHP classes, which allows you to define complex behaviors and relationships between the objects.

## System Requirements

Plugin requires Grav 1.5 and PHP 5.6 in order to run.

## Installation

Typically a plugin should be installed via [GPM](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) (Grav Package Manager):

```
$ bin/gpm install flex-objects
```

Alternatively it can be installed via the [Admin Plugin](http://learn.getgrav.org/admin-panel/plugins)

## Sample Data

Once installed you can either create entries manually, or you can copy the sample data set:

```shell
$ cp user/plugins/flex-objects/data/entries.json user/data/flex-objects/contacts.json
```

## Configuration

This plugin works out of the box, but provides several fields that make modifying and extending this plugin easier:

```yaml
enabled: true
built_in_css: true
extra_admin_twig_path: 'theme://admin/templates'
extra_site_twig_path:
directories:
  - blueprints://flex-objects/contacts.yaml
```

Simply edit the **Flex Objects** plugin options in the Admin plugin, or copy the `flex-objects.yaml` default file to your `user/config/plugins/` folder and edit the values there.   Read below for more help on what these fields do and how they can help you modify the plugin.

Most interesting configuration option is `directiories`, which contains list or blueprint files which will define the flex types.

## Displaying

To display the directory simply add the following to our Twig template or even your page content (with Twig processing enabled):

```twig
---
title: Contacts
process:
  markdown: false
  twig: true
directory: contacts
---
{% include 'flex-objects/directory.html.twig' %}
```

Alternatively just create a page called `flex-objects.md` or set the template of your existing page to `template: flex-objects`.  This will use the `flex-objects.html.twig` file provided by the plugin.

If you do not specify directory name in the page header, the page will list all directories instead of displaying entries from a single directory.

# Modifications

This plugin is configured with a sample contacts directory with a few sample fields:

* published
* first_name
* last_name
* email
* website
* tags

These are probably not the exact fields you might want, so you will probably want to change them. This is pretty simple to do with Flex Objects, you just need to change the **Blueprints** and the **Twig Templates**.  This can be achieved simply enough by copying some current files and modifying them.

Let's assume you simply want to add a new "Phone Number" field to the existing Data and remove the "Tags".  These are the steps you would need to perform:

1. Copy the `blueprints/flex-objects/contacts.yaml` Blueprint file to another location, let's say `user/blueprints/flex-objects/`. The file can really be stored anywhere, but if you are using admin, it is best to keep the blueprint file where admin can automatically find it.

1. Edit the `user/blueprints/flex-objects/contacts.yaml` like so:

    ```yaml
    title: Contacts
    description: Simple contact directory with phone number.
    type: flex-objects
    
    config:
      admin:
        list:
          title: name
          fields:
            published:
              width: 8
            last_name:
              link: edit
            first_name:
              link: edit
            email:
            website:
            tags:
      data:
        storage: user://data/flex-objects/contacts.json
    
    form:
      validation: loose
    
      fields:
        published:
          type: toggle
          label: Published
          highlight: 1
          default: 1
          options:
            1: PLUGIN_ADMIN.YES
            0: PLUGIN_ADMIN.NO
          validate:
            type: bool
            required: true
    
        first_name:
          type: text
          label: First Name
          validate:
            required: true
    
        last_name:
          type: text
          label: Last Name
          validate:
            required: true
    
        email:
          type: email
          label: Email Address
          validate:
            required: true
    
        website:
          type: url
          label: Web Site
    
        phone:
          type: text
          label: Phone
    ```

    Notice how we removed the `tags:` Blueprint field definition, and added a simple text field for `phone:`.  If you have questions about available form fields, [check out the extensive documentation](https://learn.getgrav.org/forms/blueprints/fields-available) on the subject.

1. We need to copy the frontend Twig file and modify it to add the new "Phone" field.  By default your theme already has its `templates`, so we can take advantage of it <sup>2</sup>. We'll simply copy the `user/plugins/flex-objects/templates/flex-objects/types/contacts.html.twig` file to `user/themes/antimatter/templates/flex-objects/types/contacts.html.twig`. Notice, there is no reference to `admin/` here, this is site template, not an admin one.

1. Edit the `contacts.html.twig` file you just copied so it has these modifications:

    ```twig
        <li>
            <div class="entry-details">
                {% if entry.website %}
                    <a href="{{ entry.website }}"><span class="name">{{ entry.last_name }}, {{ entry.first_name }}</span></a>
                {% else %}
                    <span class="name">{{ entry.last_name }}, {{ entry.first_name }}</span>
                {% endif %}
                {% if entry.email %}
                    <p><a href="mailto:{{ entry.email }}" class="email">{{ entry.email }}</a></p>
                {% endif %}
                {% if entry.phone %}
                    <p class="phone">{{ entry.phone }}</p>
                {% endif %}
            </div>
        </li>
    ```

    And also the JavaScript initialization which provides which hooks up certain classes to the search:
    
    ```html
    <script>
        var options = {
            valueNames: [ 'name', 'email', 'website', 'phone' ]
        };
    
        var userList = new List('flex-objects', options);
    </script>
    ```

    Notice, we removed the `entry-extra` DIV, and added a new `if` block with the Twig code to display the phone number if set.

# File Upload

To upload files you can use the `file` form field.  []The standard features apply](https://learn.getgrav.org/forms/blueprints/how-to-add-file-upload), and you can simply edit your custom blueprint with a field definition similar to:

```
    item_image:
      type: file
      label: Item Image
      random_name: true
      destination: 'user/data/flex-objects/files'
      multiple: true
```

# Advanced

You can radically alter the structure of the `entries.json` data file by making major edits to the `contacts.yaml` blueprint file.  However, it's best to start with an empty `contacts.json` if you are making wholesale changes or you will have data conflicts.  Best to create your blueprint first.  Reloading a **New Entry** until the form looks correct, then try saving, and check to make sure the stored `user/data/flex-objects/contacts.json` file looks correct.

Then you will need to make more widespread changes to the site Twig templates.  You might need to adjust the number of columns and the field names.  You will also need to pay attention to the JavaScript initialization in each template.

# Features

Here are the main benefits of using Flex objects:

* CRUD is automatically handled for you by Flex Objects plugin
* Flex types can be easily extended by custom PHP collection and object classes
* Both Flex objects and collections know how to render themselves: `echo $object->render($layout, $context)`
* You can easily create custom layouts for your objects and collections to be used in different pages
* Both Flex objects and collections support serialization and `json_encode()`
* Flex objects support Grav `Medium` objects with few lines of code
* Flex objects can have relations to other Flex objects with few lines of code defining the relation

# Limitations and future improvements

Right now there are a few limitations:

* Administration needs more features like filtering, bulk updates etc
* It would be nice to have an easy way to display Flex admin in other admin plugins (and hide the type from Flex)
* All entries are stored in a single json or yaml file
* Optional database storage layer would be nice to have
* We need general collection functions to do simple filtering, like: "display all published items" without custom PHP code
* We need indexes which allow searching objects without loading all of them
* There is no caching for object and collection rendering

### Notes:

1. You can actually use pretty much any folder under the `user/` folder of Grav. Simply edit the **Extra Admin Twig Path** option in the `flex-objects.yaml` file.  It defaults to `theme://admin/templates` which means it uses the default theme's `admin/templates/` folder if it exists.
2. You can use any path for front end Twig templates also, if you don't want to put them in your theme, you can add an entry in the **Extra Site Twig Path** option of the `flex-objects.yaml` configuration and point to another location.
